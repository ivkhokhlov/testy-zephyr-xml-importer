Selected task: ZEP-100 — Importer integration via TestY services.  
Acceptance: create-only skip by `attributes.zephyr.key`.  
Updated plan in `.agent/plan.md` with adapter-based integration steps.  
Appended planner entry to `.agent/progress.md` (CODEX_ITERATION=14).  
Queue edits: none.  
Worker: define a minimal TestY adapter/protocol and in-memory test adapter.  
Worker: implement create-only import path with suite creation and duplicate skip.  
Worker: wire non-dry-run path in `zephyr_xml_importer/api/views.py` to new importer.  
Worker: add unit tests validating duplicate skip and report action `skipped`.  
Worker: keep TestY imports behind conditional adapter to preserve unit-testability.  
Worker: run `pytest -q` at the end; run `python -m ruff check .` if available.  
End of planner run.
